\section{Definitions}

\begin{definition}[\cindex{Cauchy sequence}]
    A sequence $\set{x_i}$ is Cauchy sequence in $(X, d)$ if for any $\epsilon > 0$, there is an $N_\epsilon$ that 
    \begin{equation}
        n, m \geq N_\epsilon \Rightarrow d(x_n, x_m) \leq \epsilon
    \end{equation}
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}[\cindex{complete}]
    A metric space $(X,d)$ is complete if every Cauchy sequence converges. Every convergent sequence is Cauchy. So the definition need the reverse relation.
\end{definition}


\begin{theorem}
    The space $\realnumber^N$ is complete
\end{theorem}
\begin{theorem}
    A Cauchy sequence is abounded. Choose an interval $[-m, m]$ that is compact and contains all sequence. It has a convergent subsequence.
\end{theorem}
